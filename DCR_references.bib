	abstract = {The theoretical background and present status of formulas for the refractive index of air are reviewed. In supplement to Edl\'{e}n's recently revised formula for relative refractivity, the density dependence of refractive index is reanalyzed. New formulas are presented for both phase and group refractive index which are more useful over a wide range of pressure, temperature, and composition than any presently available. The application of the new formulas to optical distance measuring is briefly discussed.},
